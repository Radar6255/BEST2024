# When you 'declare' a variable, you put the name of the new variable on the left of the = sign, and the value of the variable on the right
# ex.
# name = value

integer1 = 5
integer2 = -20
float1 = 4.2
boolean1 = True
string1 = "This is a string of characters"
string2 = "20"
string3 = "9.8"
string4 = "False"
list1 = [ 5, 1, 3, 20, 0, 1, 30000 ]

# You can print any variable to see its value
print("An 'int' is an integer (whole) number, which can be positive or negative. Here are two examples:")
print(integer1)
print(integer2)
print # print an empty line for spacing the output
print("A 'float' is any number, including decimal numbers. The name 'float' comes from 'floating point', which describes how a computer keeps track of the decimal point. Here's an example of a float:")
print(float1)
print
print("A 'boolean' value is always either True or False. Here's an example:")
print(boolean1)
print
print("A 'string' can be any bunch of characters. Strings are denoted by surrounding quotes. A string can even contain a value that looks like an int, boolean, or float, but if it's surrounded by quotes in your code, it's a string! Here are some examples:")
print(string1)
print(string2)
print(string3)
print(string4)
print
print("A 'list' is a collection of items of any data type. Each item in the list is called an 'element' of the list.  The elements are surrounded by [brackets] and separated by commas. You can mix and match anything you want in a list, but typically we make lists where all elements are of the same type. Here's an example:")
print(list1)
